# Token Time Lock

## Project Description
A smart contract system that enables time-locked token transfers with customizable release schedules. Users can deposit tokens that become available to beneficiaries only after a specified time period expires.

## Project Vision

- **Automated Release**: Tokens automatically become claimable after lock period
- **Secure Storage**: Utilizes Aptos Move's resource system for safe token custody
- **Flexible Duration**: Support for any lock duration from seconds to years

## Future Scope
- **Multi-Release Schedules**: Support for vesting with multiple unlock dates
- **Partial Releases**: Allow percentage-based token releases over time
- **Revocation Features**: Enable depositors to cancel locks under certain conditions  
- **Multi-Token Support**: Extend beyond AptosCoin to any token type
